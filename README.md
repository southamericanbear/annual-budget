# Payment Calculator App

This is a simple payment calculator app that I built for fun as a developer. It is designed to help with currency conversions and managing taxes and fees, which can be especially complicated in Argentina when dealing with USD payments.

## Purpose

As developers, we often face various challenges, and payments are no exception. Living in Argentina, I found it particularly challenging to keep up with the fluctuating exchange rates and the many taxes and fees associated with receiving payments in USD. So, I created this app to make my life a little easier.

## Features

The app provides a user-friendly interface for:

- Converting USD to Argentine Pesos
- Calculating taxes and fees associated with receiving USD payments in Argentina
- Keeping track of exchange rates
